# Contributing to smartCFL

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Coda Formula Language integration for Antigravity!

## How to Contribute

### Adding Example Formulas

If you have useful CFL patterns to share:

1. Add them to the appropriate file in `examples/`:
   - `basic-formulas.coda` - Simple, single-function examples
   - `intermediate-formulas.coda` - Multi-step patterns with context
   - `advanced-formulas.coda` - Complex chaining and optimization

2. Include comments explaining:
   - What the formula does
   - When to use it
   - Any important considerations

### Improving Documentation

- Enhance guides in `coda-reference/`
- Add troubleshooting tips to `README.md`
- Create additional validation scenarios

### Reporting Issues

If you find problems:
- Syntax highlighting not working as expected
- Documentation inaccuracies
- Agent generation issues

Please provide:
- Your Antigravity version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior

- Use case description
- Complete formula with comments
- Example data structure
- Performance considerations (if applicable)
